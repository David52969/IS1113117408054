			<h2>Software as a Service - <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/eu/">Salesforce</a></h2>
		<p>Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus</p>
		<p>services" by Microsoft. SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software, messaging software, payroll processing</p>
		<p>software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, virtualization, accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), Management Information Systems (MIS), enterprise</p>
		<p>resource planning (ERP), invoicing, human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition, learning management systems, content management (CM), and service desk management. SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of nearly all</p>
		<p>leading enterprise software companies.</p>

		<h2>Platform as a Service -<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/"> Cloud9</a></h2>
				<p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the</p>
				<p>complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software</p>
				<p>deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the </p>
				<p>consumer's application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.</p>

			<h2 style=>Infrastructure as a Service - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h2>
			<p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, </p>
			<p>security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of </p>
			<p>virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, </p>
			<p>firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles.</p>

			<h2 style=>Communication as a Service - <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/">Gmail</a></h2>
			<p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) provides Software as a Service (SaaS) for communications. There is no standard specification as to what is included in CaaS. Implementations vary. CaaS could include unified communications,</p>
			<p>broadcasting, individual calls (voice and video), conferencing (voice and video), voice over IP (VoIP), messaging, and so on.</p>
